Heart Disease Prediction using PyTorch
A neural network model to predict heart disease risk from patient data

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project trains a PyTorch neural network to predict heart disease risk using clinical features like cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and ECG results.

Key Features:

1. Preprocesses mixed numerical/categorical data

2. Implements a customizable neural network

3. Tracks and visualizes training progress

4. Achieves ~85-90% test accuracy
